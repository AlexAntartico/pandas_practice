    "When Unix was invented, there was *only* the shell. Back then, \"the shell\" was the Bourne Shell, it was called sh. A few years later, Berkley invented BSD Unix, including the 'csh'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these was then upgraded a bit: AT&T came out with the Korn Shell (ksh), which was a superset of the Bourne Shell. BSD came out with 'tcsh', a superset of csh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though people used different shells interactively, these shells were programming languages that you could write 'scripts'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, there were two more 'upgrades' in the shell world:\n",
    "\n",
    "- GNU came up with bash, Bourne-Again Shell. This was a combination of 'tcsh' and 'ksh', giving you the best of both worlds.\n",
    "- Zsh came out at around the same time and was also a superset of 'tcsh' and 'ksh', but had a lots of additional functionality and was smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few years ago, Apple changed the default shell to be 'zsh' instead of 'bash'.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to change your default shell, you can use the 'chsh' command. You can also run a shell as a command to try it, rather than switching your login shell."

    "The most important is `path` which is a list of directories separated by \":\". When you give the name of a program you want to run, and if it's not a shell builtin command, then the shell looks through the `PATH`, one directory at a time, until it finds the program you've named. The first match gets executed and runs. If no match is found you will probably get a command not found error.\n",
